                Welcome to Hoop Forums! This is your place to discuss all things basketball.
                This is a place for anyone- from your casual fan, to basketball enthusiasts,
                or even those new to the NBA- to come together and talk about anything related
                to the National Basketball Association.
            </p>

            <p>If you've visited Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/">NBA page</a> before, the idea here is very
            similar. Users come together online to share their thoughts/opinions and fun facts about the league and its members.</p>

            <p>
                Thank you for coming to my website, I hope you enjoy! If there are any questions or
                concerns, please reach out via the 
                <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> tab.
