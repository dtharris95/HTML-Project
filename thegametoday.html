                The NBA is larger and more global than ever before! It is on the backs of those that came
                before that the league stands on today. Because of their contributions to the league,
                the NBA is one of the most popular leagues around the world! This is evident in the conversations had surrounding 
                the league on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, in an unofficial community known to fans as "NBA Twitter", not
                to be confused with the NBA's official Twitter page. 
                Since NBA Twitter has no official page, you can find discussions amongst fans via going to Twitter's search bar
                and entering any NBA related news.
